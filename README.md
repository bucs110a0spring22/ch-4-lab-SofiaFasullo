_Replace anything surrounded by the `< >` symbols._

## SUMMARY:
My program defines 3 functions, drawSineCurve(myturtle=None) which draws a sine curve from -360 degrees to 360 degrees across the x,y axis, setupWindow(mywindow=None) which zooms in the window to the sine curve bounds, and setupAxis(myturtle=None) which has my turtle draw a line along the x and y axes. Then these functions are called in a larger function, main().
